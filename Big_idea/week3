After my conversation with Martin and Mr. Fraser , i decided that i will continue with my Dyspraxia idea. It is different 
from the first one that i had. Doing research and conversation with dyspraxic people, i decided that 
i will try to focus in their daily routine. My next step was to try and thing what is the most common thing that people do.
It is the doorknob and because most of us we forget things and we realise it after we left.
Also, that's the biggest concern for dyspraxic people, they cannot remember where are their items or to take with 
them important list (i.e shopping list). My idea is to connect the doorknob alarm which will connect with RFID stickers for the items
(i.e keys,pursue.charger) and note boards connected with the LCD display and speakers next to the door. So when the user will touch the doorknob 
the LCD display will show the items that they are 10m away from the user and he will give him the location of the items. Also, it will show
the notes that might be in the note board. The speaker next to the LCD display will be there in case that the user wont see the LCD so the 
speaker will read what the LCD display appears. 
That product would be used not only for dyspraxic people but also, for people at the first stages of Alzheimer or people that forget their items 
very often.
